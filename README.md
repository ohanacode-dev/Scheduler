# Scheduler

This is a stable version 3.

Check out: http://scheduleservice.ohanacode-dev.com/

Scheduling services apps provide access to my web scheduleservice. The idea is that you can upload your schedule, 
or have someone else upload it and then you can view it in a simple list using an android or a desktop application.

here I provide the source code for both Android app and Qt based desktop app running on Windows and Linux. 
The service has an API you can use for your own apps too.
